---------------



SPAN develops products that accelerate the rapid adoption of renewable energy in the home. The flagship SPAN Smart Panel is the first true evolution for the traditional home electric panel, harnessing enhanced technology for metering, monitoring, and control. An expanded product suite of intelligent, integrated solutions radically lowers the cost and complexity of energy upgrades–including solar, batteries and EVs–empowering homeowners to be active, resilient and informed players in the energy market.


**The Team and Role**
---------------------



SPAN’s Device Software team is responsible for all of the software that is physically embodied in our hardware products. Our first product - the SPAN Panel - contains a complex network of microcontrollers and a single board computer that must work together to react quickly to changing conditions with impeccable reliability in order to perform its job. We look for friendly, excellent engineers who enjoy working with their peers to solve complex problems and prioritize trusting that the people we hire are capable of great things when well supported. Engineers work directly with the broader software, product, and hardware teams to ensure the right things get built at the right time.



As a principal engineer on the Device Software team you will define and implement new features directly related to SPAN’s hardware products focusing on the lowest level - the microcontroller. This includes everything from bootloaders on systems without an OS up through applications in C and C++ inside an RTOS. Hardware products are central to SPAN’s business and writing firmware for even our smallest microcontrollers means working on something that directly impacts the user experience. You will own large user-facing features from conception through implementation on future hardware products, working independently to bring them to completion.


**Representative Projects**
---------------------------


* Designing an OTA system that encompasses a variety of communication interfaces, processor types, and products, while achieving both secure goals for hardware-backed encryption and verification and high reliability.
* Working with system architects to invent a data steaming architecture for a new product family which can satisfy both the needs of the data science team to access high rate and quality data, as well as safety guarantees around consistency and accuracy.
* Representing the Device Software team in group settings and evangelizing engineering best practices. Participating in code and design reviews as well as authoring documents which further reinforce these goals, and supporting engineers across the org in hitting them.

Our satellite system will provide the first ever high-accuracy global navigation and timing services with the security and resilience modern applications need to operate safely at scale.

To succeed in this role where software meets hardware, successful candidates will have a desire to embrace challenges; listen to understand; persevere in the face of failure; be open to innovative ideas and find inspiration in others’ success.


This role requires a very good understanding of system software; excellent debugging skills; effective communication to help drive the project in a multi functional team environment. Important to have a team first approach and the ability to resolve problems and help the team to build and ship quality products.

**Basic Qualifications**

* Hands on experience in C / C++ programming, Device Drivers.
* 5+ years of experience in Kernel development.

**Preferred Qualifications:**

* Network or Storage device driver development in either Linux, Windows or ESX.
* Deep understanding of Windows Kernel Internals, Development and Certification environment.
* Experience using tools such as Tcpdump/Wireshark to analyze network traffic.
* Device driver and kernel debugging skills with WinDbg and ability to triage Windows crash dumps.
